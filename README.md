# Resume
This is a collection of my skills throughout my learning experience in the classroom and out of the classroom.
I am currently learning and applying my newly learned skills from a Udemy course on nodejs and also another course on full stack developement with React. 
I am building my own personal website with the goal to show off my skills and what I can offer to a future employer. This project is currently in its infant stage. The plan for the next few weeks of my second semester Junior year is to create a fully responsive modern website for my portfolio. I plan to share a lot of my newly aquired skills on this repository. I plan to host this site utilizing the Azure Cloud. This will be probably later by the summer time once this semester is concucluded in May of 2021.
