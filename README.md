# Resume
This is a collection of my skills throughout my learning experience in the classroom and out of the classroom.
I am currently learning and applying my newly learned skills from a Udemy course on nodejs and also another couser on front end development with React. 
I am building my own personal website with the goal to show off my skills and what I can offer to a future employer. This project is currently in its infant stage.
